  'Russet': '''Also known as Idaho, bakers, or Burbank potatoes

Most potatoes grown in the US are of the russet variety, meaning they're what most people picture when you say "potato." With a mildly rough brown-grey skin, the flesh once cooked is light and fluffy and the skin becomes chewy.

Best uses: Roasting, baking, or mashing'''
